      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <title>(Hu)go Template Primer</title>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Step 1. Install Hugo Goto hugo releases and download the appropriate version for your os and architecture.
Save it somewhere specific as we will be using it in the next step.
More complete instructions are available at installing hugo
Step 2. Build the Docs Hugo has its own example site which happens to also be the documentation site you are reading right now.
Follow the following steps:
 Clone the hugo repository Go into the repo Run hugo in server mode and build the docs Open your browser to http://localhost:1313  Corresponding pseudo commands:</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>I am a first-year graduate student in astronomy at Harvard University.
I am primarily interested in the interpretation of complicated datasets with numerical simulations. This has led me to my interests in the Milky Way and the Epoch of Reionization, both of which either currently have or will soon have enormous datasets with no clear path towards their interpretation. As I begin my PhD, these will be my focus.</description>

Animated versions of Figures 5 and 6.    Figure 5. While young stars are clumped in action/velocity space, old stars are spread out - but not preferentially towards any part of action/velocity space.
   Figure 6. Each subplot rotates, to better visualize the 3D plot. While previosuly we only considered slices in action space, this 3D plots shows that there is no clear distinction in the entirety of action space between young and old stars.</description>

      <description>A full list of publications can be found on ADS or my CV.
I am broadly interested in the interpretation of complicated datasets, particularly in the role and fidelity of numerical simulations in the pursuit of that goal. In the near-term, this means understanding the current and imminent surveys of the Milky Way. In the long-term, this will hopefully lead me to study the Epoch of Reionization.
The Milky Way Galaxy formation is a complicated topic.</description>
