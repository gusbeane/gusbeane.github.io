      <description>My research!
   My title with Melissa Ness and Megan Bedell Over time, stellar orbits are expected to become more non-circular and non-planar, described by their orbit&amp;#39;s actions. Using two samples of stars with well-determined ages, we quantify the action-age relations and demonstrate a correlation. However, the spread on this relation is too large for actions to be used to infer stellar ages. arXiv   ApJ Submitted    Animated Figures           My title with Melissa Ness and Megan Bedell Over time, stellar orbits are expected to become more non-circular and non-planar, described by their orbit&amp;#39;s actions.</description>
